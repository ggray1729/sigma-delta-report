%section on all the design details

\subsection{Noise in  Switched Capacitor Integrator}
\label{Design:noise}
%estimating the capacitor sizes for different OSRs
%use this to compare designs

\subsection{Modulator Choice}
%based on the different combinations of bits, order and OSR that could meet the required specification

%reference the textbook, show the graphs and list the different options tested in matlab

%but then have to choose between single stage and multiple stage designs


%so will need to compare the single stage designs here to some multi-stage designs
