\section{Introduction}
%just a couple of paragraphs introducing the report
This report details the design a Sigma-Delta modulator in a design exercise.
The specifications of this modulator are described in section \ref{Design}.
Full simulation of the design in macro-model in Cadence was not completed due to time constraints but no problems are anticipated.

Time constraints were aggravated due to experimentation with a CIFB design that required extensive modification in Simulink to be succesfully verified.
Unfortunately, there were many bugs encountered due to inexperience editing Simulink models.
Finally, this design was abandoned in favour of a more established design that could meet the specifications.

A 2+1 MASH converter was chosen with an OSR of 128 to give adequate margin on the specifications.
It is shown that this is a robust design that is capable of meeting the specifications.
%THEN SAY UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS NOT FEASIBLE TO IMPLEMENT A DESIGN THIS COMPLEX IN CADENCE IN THE TIME AVAILABLE
